Hello, Internet 🌎 Despite the great journey filled with challenges and learnings, I haven’t found product market fit for this project. Given this, and my current lack of bandwidth and will to continue improving and maintaining it, I’ve arhivie it and move forward. However, I believe this project still holds potential, and I hope someone with the necessary passion and resources might take it forward. 

If you’re interested, feel free to fork the repo and continue its development.

Thank y'all for your support and understanding.
